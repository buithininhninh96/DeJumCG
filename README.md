# De-Jumble Chrysanthemum Garden’s Jumbled Paragraph – version 1.1

# Description:
Extracts the plaintext/original text from the jumbled text that was a result of copy-pasting the content in Chrysanthemum Garden’s translated web-novel. As a fellow bookworm without constant internet connection, it’s understandable that we prefer reading e-books offline, thus we ‘steal’ content and put it in a offline read-able format. Sometimes, the content we ‘steal’ have security features/watermark and we totally understand the hard-work put into making these content, taking Chrysanthemum Garden’s blog for example (I recommend to read in the blog, honestly, if you can afford to) with their post-copy-pasted jumbled sentence. But, from personal expeirence, sometimes internet isn’t always there for us to escape reality!

# How it works:
Once the page loads, browser will open a prompt window where jumbled text shall be pasted on. Once entered and confirmed, the page will display the plain original text. To re-use, simply refresh page, or hit F5.

or
To load it offline on your computer [on Windows]:
1. Copy the code below and then paste it on Notepad.
2. Save file’s name as “(name).html” and then exit Notepad.
3. Open saved file directly, and it should open in a browser.

# Update Log:
- Added missing case for de-jumbling the letter “J”. Kudos to GreatefulReader for the notice. May you read all the BLs in peace.
